                    <h2>Curious about me?</h2>
                    <p>I am a specialist with a background in computer engineering, whose career combines analytics, content creation, and a passion for technology. My unique skill is the ability to see projects at the intersection of technical logic, marketing strategy, and human psychology.</p>
                    <p>In 2023, I immersed myself in the world of e-commerce as a content manager for the Synthetic marketplace, where I learned to analyze the market and create sales pitches. At the same time, I developed my video-making skills: from scriptwriting to professional editing in <strong>DaVinci Resolve</strong>, working on color correction and sound design for TikTok and YouTube.</p>
                    <p><strong>Today, my main focus is on web development.</strong> I am actively studying modern development technologies, and I created the website you are currently visiting entirely on my own. For me, it's not just code, but an opportunity to combine my experience in design, visual content, and engineering to create a high-quality user experience.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, I am exploring 3D graphics and VR, believing that the future of productivity lies in virtual environments. My interest in the psychology of self-development helps me stay focused and find unconventional solutions in every new line of code or video frame.</p>

                    <p>A few facts about me:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (ZNU, 2024).</li>
